2. **Download notebooks** - Save your work locally
3. **Upload to GitHub** - Share and collaborate
4. **Develop locally** - Complex scenes with full features

## 📊 Quality Settings

- **`-ql`** - Low quality (fast, good for development)
- **`-qm`** - Medium quality (balanced)
- **`-qh`** - High quality (slow, for final renders)

## 💡 Tips
